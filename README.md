## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Complexity Analysis

#### Part 1: Graph Operations

- **Add Referral**: O(V) for cycle detection using DFS
- **Query Referrals**: O(1) using adjacency list storage

#### Part 2: Network Reach

- **Total Referral Count**: O(V + E) using BFS traversal
- **Top Referrers**: O(V × (V + E)) for all-user analysis

#### Part 3: Influencer Metrics

- **Unique Reach**: O(k × V²) greedy selection algorithm
- **Flow Centrality**: O(V³) for all-pairs shortest path computation

#### Part 4: Simulation

- **Growth Simulation**: O(days × referrers) discrete-time modeling
- **Target Calculation**: O(log(days) × simulation_complexity) binary search

#### Part 5: Optimization

- **Bonus Optimization**: O(log(bonus_range) × simulation_complexity) binary search
- **Time Complexity**: Logarithmic in bonus range, linear in simulation parameters

### Business Metric Comparisons

#### 1. Total Reach

- **Best for**: Overall network size assessment
- **Scenario**: Measuring platform growth and user acquisition success
- **Advantages**: Simple to understand and communicate

#### 2. Unique Reach Expansion

- **Best for**: Marketing campaign optimization
- **Scenario**: Selecting diverse influencers to minimize audience overlap
- **Advantages**: Maximizes coverage with minimal resources

#### 3. Flow Centrality

- **Best for**: Network resilience analysis
- **Scenario**: Identifying critical users whose loss would fragment the network
- **Advantages**: Reveals structural importance beyond simple reach

## 📦 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🔧 Dependencies

### Core Framework

- **React 18**: Latest React with concurrent features

## 🎯 Key Insights

### Algorithm Performance

The implementation prioritizes correctness over optimization for clarity. Production systems would benefit from:

- Graph preprocessing for faster centrality calculations
- Memoization of expensive computations
- Incremental updates for dynamic networks

### Business Applications

Each metric serves distinct business needs:

- **Reach**: User acquisition and growth tracking
- **Unique Reach**: Marketing efficiency and budget allocation
- **Flow Centrality**: Network stability and risk assessment

### Scalability Considerations

Current implementation handles networks up to ~1000 users efficiently. For larger networks:

- Consider approximation algorithms for centrality metrics
- Implement graph sampling techniques
- Use specialized graph databases for storage

Built with ❤️ for the Mercor Challenge+ Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
